This repo hosts the code and models of "[BAT: Learning to Reason about Spatial Sounds with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01591)" [ICML 2024 [bib](https://github.com/zszheng147/Spatial-AST#citation)]. 

Checkout our [demo page](https://zhishengzheng.com/BAT/) and enjoy a QA game with spatial audio.

## Performance and checkpoints

## Data preparation
You need to prepare the data jsonl in this format. Below is an example.  
You can download the SpatialSoundQA dataset from [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/zhisheng01/SpatialSoundQA).
```
{"audio_id": "eval/audio/YI-HlrcP6Qg4", "reverb_id": "q9vSo1VnCiC/0.npy", "audio_id2": null, "reverb_id2": null, "question_id": 0, "question_type": "CLASSIFICATION", "question": "Enumerate the sound occurrences in the audio clip.", "answer": "accelerating, revving, vroom; car; vehicle"}
...
{"audio_id": "eval/audio/YZX2fVPmUidA", "reverb_id": "q9vSo1VnCiC/32.npy", "audio_id2": "eval/audio/YjNjUU01quLs", "reverb_id2": "q9vSo1VnCiC/31.npy", "question_id": 58, "question_type": "MIXUP_NONBINARY_DISTANCE", "question": "How far away is the sound of the banjo from the sound of the whack, thwack?", "answer": "2m"}
```

## Train a new model
```bash
bash examples/seld_spatialsoundqa/scripts/finetune_spatial-ast_qformer_llama_2_7b.sh
```

## Decoding with checkpoints
```bash
bash examples/seld_spatialsoundqa/scripts/decode_spatial-ast_qformer_llama_2_7b.sh
```


## TODO
- [x] Decode with checkpoints
- [x] Upload SpatialSoundQA dataset
- [ ] Upload pretrained checkpoints
- [ ] Update model performance
