    "* how to use LangChain to load a recent PDF doc - the Llama2 paper pdf - and ask questions about it. This is the well known RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) method to let LLM such as Llama2 be able to answer questions about the data not publicly available when Llama2 was trained, or about your own data. RAG is one way to prevent LLM's hallucination. "

Christensen argues that these companies are faced with a dilemma because they have invested so heavily in their existing products and processes that it is difficult for them to pivot and embrace new, disruptive technologies. He also introduces the concept of \"disruptive innovation,\" which he defines as a process by which a small company with limited resources is able to successfully challenge established industry leaders."
