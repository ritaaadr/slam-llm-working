Meta's Quest is the bestseller in the nascent VR space and the company's executives described it as the best value in the industry, a nod to the impending release of a much more expensive headset from Apple (AAPL.O).\\nSpeaking from a central courtyard on Meta's sprawling Silicon Valley campus, Zuckerberg said a new generation of Meta's Ray-Ban (ESLX.PA) smart glasses would start shipping on Oct. 17, priced at $299.\",\n",
      "        \"Meta AI will be built in to the smart glasses as an assistant, starting with a beta rollout in the United States. A software update planned for next year will give the assistant the ability to identify places and objects that people are seeing, as well as to perform language translation.\\nMeta made Meta AI using a custom model based on the powerful Llama 2 large language model that the company released for public commercial use in July. The chatbot will have access to real-time information via a partnership with Microsoft's (MSFT.O) Bing search engine, Zuckerberg said.\\nIn an interview with Reuters, Meta Global Affairs President Nick Clegg said the company had taken steps to filter private details from the data used to train the model and also imposed restrictions on what the tool could generate, like a ban on the creation of realistic images of public figures.\",\n",
      "        \"\\\"I don't see monetization of AI products happening for Meta for quite some time and I think it will end up being more indirect. They seem much more interested in helping develop a platform that other developers will use,\\\" said Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at TECHnalysis Research.\\nZuckerberg also said on Wednesday that Xbox cloud gaming is coming to Quest in December.\\nMeta first announced the Quest 3 headset over the summer, around the time Apple debuted its Vision Pro headset, a high-end product with a price of $3,500.\\nStarting at $500, the Quest 3 boasts the same mixed-reality technology that premiered in Meta's more expensive Quest Pro device launched last year, which shows wearers a video feed of the real world around them.\\nThe day's announcements reflect how Zuckerberg plans to navigate the shift this year of investor fervor to artificial intelligence from augmented and virtual reality technologies.\",\n",
      "        \"Stakes for the event were high as investors last year slammed the parent company of Facebook and Instagram for spending extensively on the metaverse, prompting Zuckerberg to lay off tens of thousands of staff to continue funding his vision.\\nDevelopers were watching to assess what apps they might create for Meta's latest hardware devices.

We went ahead and gathered everything announced at the show right here, so you can find out what matters to you.\\nMeta Quest 3 - Mixed Reality for All?\\nThe Meta Quest 2 was a virtual reality headset, and while the Meta Quest 3 can do that, it differs by having cameras that allow your content to exist in the same world you do. It does this with two dedicated color sensors and a depth sensor that will allow you to do things like previewing furniture in your room.\",\n",

The idea here is to use AI image generation and manipulation to create fun photos to send to friends and even create custom stickers at the drop of a dime, whether you're in chat or commenting on a friend's post.\\nBeyond Meta's own AI models, the company is using this to create a platform for developers to develop AI models for Meta's massive userbase.

However, with the price tag going up to $499, it might be a little harder to afford for \\\"everyone.\\\" But either way, you can buy it Oct. 10, 2023.\\nEmu - AI Comes to Instagram\",\n",

It can do this by using built-in cameras to scan what you're looking at, so if we're going off of Meta's example, you can look at a leaky faucet, ask Meta AI how to fix it, and get advice.\\nYou'll also be able to livestream your point of view from your Rayban Meta Smartglasses to your audience, whether that's just friends and family or a wider group of people.\\nIf you want these new smartglasses, you can get them Oct. 17, starting at $299.\"\n",

While we do already know it's coming, there's very little we actually know about the upcoming headset. Back in June, Meta released a little announcement trailer showing off the next-generation VR headset, along with its $499 price tag.\\nAt Meta Connect 3, however, we'll likely see what's powering the standalone headset. All we know in this regard is that once again it will be powered by a Snapdragon SoC and apparently features twice the GPU power as the Meta Quest 3. Meta somehow found a way to do this while also slimming down the headset itself, so we'd expect Meta to go into some detail about how it made this happen. After all, with this kind of horsepower, thermals are a problem, and slimming down the device is going to take some pretty impressive engineering.\",\n",
      "        \"We might already know the Meta Quest 3 is on the way, but we don't know what's actually going to packed inside the next best VR headset. Luckily, with Meta Connect starting tomorrow, that question, and many more are going to be answered.\\nMeta Connect 3 is going to be a two day event, likely packed with VR games and apps, but the main event is going to be the keynote, happening on September 27 at 10 AM PST / 1PM EST / 5 PM BST. Unlike a lot of tech events, the Meta Quest 3 is confirmed to be there. What this event is for, then, is showing off what the Meta Quest 3 can actually do. And with Meta hot off the heels of the Apple Vision Pro reveal, we expect it's going to be a huge show.\\nWhen is Meta Connect 3?\",\n",
      "        \"We also know that along with the faster GPU, the Meta Quest 3 will have higher-resolution displays than the last go-around. Again, Meta has just claimed that the displays are a higher resolution, it hasn't said what the resolution would be. The Meta Quest 2 already boasted an impressive 1,920 x 1,832 resolution per eye, so Meta may have stepped up to a vertical resolution of 2,560, to match the boom in QHD monitors the best gaming PCs have been experiencing. However, that would require a heap more GPU power to pull off, so the \\\"faster GPU\\\" better be real.\\nBeyond that, we expect Meta to flesh out its Meta Quest+ a bit more to entice new users into its ecosystem. For those unaware, Meta Quest+ is a $7.99 a month subscription service that offers a wide variety of VR titles. Think of it as Xbox Game Pass, but for VR content.\"\n",
