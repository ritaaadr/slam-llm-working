# Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git
cd transformers
git checkout tags/v4.35.2
pip install -e .
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/peft.git
cd peft
git checkout tags/v0.6.0
pip install -e .
cd ..
pip install torch==2.0.1 torchvision==0.15.2 torchaudio==2.0.2 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
git clone https://github.com/ddlBoJack/SLAM-LLM.git
cd SLAM-LLM
pip install  -e .
```

For some examples, you may need to use `fairseq`, the command line is as follows:
```
# you need to install fairseq before SLAM-LLM
git clone https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq
cd fairseq
pip install --editable ./
```
We also provide a docker image for convenience:
```shell
# build docker image
docker build -t slam-llm:latest .

# run docker image with gpu
docker run -it --gpus all --name slam --shm-size=256g slam-llm:latest /bin/bash
```
# Usage
## List of Recipes
We provide reference implementations of various LLM-based speech, audio, and music tasks: 
- **Speech Task**
    - [Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)](examples/asr_librispeech/README.md)
    - [Text-to-Speech (TTS)](examples/vallex/README.md)
    - [Visual Speech Recognition (VSR)](examples/vsr_LRS3/README.md)
- **Audio Task**
    - [Automated Audio Captioning (AAC)](examples/aac_audiocaps/README.md)
    - [Spatial Audio Understanding](examples/seld_spatialsoundqa/README.md)
- **Music Task**
    - [Music Caption (MC)](examples/mc_musiccaps/README.md)

## Configuration Priority
We provide hierarchical configuration inheritance relationships as follows:
```
command-line (shell file) > Hydra configuration (yaml file) > dataclass configuration (Python file)
```

# Features
- Easily extend to new models and tasks.
- Detailed recipes for training and high-performance checkpoints for inference.
- Mixed precision training which trains faster with less GPU memory on NVIDIA tensor cores. 
- Multi-GPU training with data and model parallel, supporting [DDP](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/ddp_tutorial.html), [FSDP](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/FSDP_tutorial.html) and [deepspeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed) (still need to be improved).  
- Flexible configuration based on [Hydra](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra) and [dataclass](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) allowing a combination of code, command-line and file based configuration. 

# Acknowledge
- We borrow code from [Llama-Recipes](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-recipes) for the training process. 
- We borrow code from [Fairseq](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq) for deepspeed configuration. 
- We thank the contributors for providing diverse recipes.
